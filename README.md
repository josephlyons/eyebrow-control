# Term 2 - Joe Lyons





































_How Might We:_

**Control the world with our eyebrows?**

​

Exploring the potential of facially controlled objects.





































## Futures Wheel - Music Streaming









































This is my futures wheel based on the trend of music consumption transitioning to streaming services such as spotify and apple music.

## Experience/Insights





















I presented a series of experimental music instruments I developed at a Hackoustic Presents night at Iklektic Artlab in London. I had the opportunity to introduce myself, and my work infront at an interactive gig of musicans, audio nerds & instrument hackers \(similar to myself\) and then give them a chance to interact with and use the instruments.

_Me speaking at the Hackoustic Presents night 22/02/20._

​

This meant that 30-40 people, over the course of a few hours, interacted with and used the instruments I developed. This gave me an amazing insight into the way in which people interact with my work and interactive objects in general.

_The three presented instruents; Proximity Box, Fan Controlled Chimes & Rotary Metronome._

​

I soon realised that battery power is _never_ the way for exhibitions - having to replace & change batteries throughout the event. But I also more deeply understood what it meant for people to interact with these instruments having never seen them, or had them be explained before.

_Different angle on the table._

​

The interactions I had created allowed you to interact with the creation of _sound_ in a different way. However, the interaction between the user and trigger, here a slider or the lid of a box, was still in everyday language.

​

This lead me to look for new & more interesting interactions.





















## Expert Interview








Plan to interview:

​

Kyle McDonald - guy who created FaceOSC using OpenFrameworks ofxFaceTracker.

## Software Guide
















Quick terminology guide for softwares used in this project.

​

**Ableton Live**

Ableton Live is a digital audio workstation for macOS and Windows.

​

**Max/MSP**

Max is a visual programming language for the specialized needs of artists, educators, and researchers working with audio, visual media, and physical computing.

​

**Max for Live**

Max for Live is a platform to build your own instruments and effects, tools for live performance and visuals, and more. It is an implementation of the Max/MSP software within Ableton Live

​

**Puredata**

Pure Data \(or just Pd \) is an open source visual programming language for multimedia. It is very similar to Max/MSP and shares a lot of the same language and structure.

​

**openFrameworks**

openFrameworks is an open source toolkit for creative coding.

​

**ofxFaceTracker**

ofxFaceTracker is openFrameworks addon for face tracking, based on Jason Saragih's FaceTracker library.

​

**FaceOSC**

FaceOSC sends as much data as possible from ofxFaceTracker via OSC, including its pose/position and gestural data, and its raw points.

​

**OSC**

Open Sound Control \(OSC\) is a protocol for communication among computers, sound synthesizers, and other multimedia devices that is optimized for modern networking technology.

​

**Arduino**

Open-source electronic prototyping platform enabling users to create interactive electronic objects.
















## Hack




For my hack I combined a handful of different softwares to create a Ableton Live Plugin that allows you too control the tempo of a Live projcect using only your eyebrows.

​

I used the Max for Live Editor within Ableton Live to unpack OSC data sent from FaceOSC, trigger a tap when a threshold was reached, and combined this with a 'tap tempo' patch and a master tempo control patch allowing me to 'tap' in the beat using my eyebrows and change the tempo in real time.

​

Potential Futures:

Studio production streamlining, Live music performance, Production accessibility.




## Further Hacks




From here I developed 3 eyebrow controlled \(EBC\) objects:

​

_EBC Skateboard_

​

This was a hack using Arduino which allowed me to control a Tony Hawk Circuit Board RC Skateboard using an Arduino & a handful of software. Allows the user to control the skateboard using only their eyebrows & a webcam.
